        <h2>About SecureCard Vault</h2>
        <p>The SecureCard Vault Project offers merchants a secure and efficient way to store and 
            manage customer credit card information. By encrypting credit card details and storing 
            them in a vault, merchants can easily invoice customers for future transactions. 
            The project includes robust data security measures such as AES encryption for sensitive data, 
            SHA-2 hashing for passwords, and role-based access control. The database is designed in 3NF for data 
            integrity and efficiency, and the project is hosted with SSL certification to ensure secure communication. 
            The goal is to provide a secure, user-friendly system that complies with data security standards and enhances the customer experience.</p>
